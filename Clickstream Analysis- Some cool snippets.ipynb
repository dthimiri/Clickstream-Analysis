    "\n",
    "###Structured data\n",
    "This notebook largely assumes that the data is organized roughly as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|      date_time      | user_id | content_id |     attr1    |           attr2           |   attr3  | ... |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###List of content accessed\n",
    "Some datasets may also be a collection of clickstream pathways, and that's fine too! We can still salvage meaningful information from these datasets. Here, each individual row corresponds to a separate session, and each element in the row represents a content ID. The order in which these content IDs are listed is typically the order in which they were accessed. This information may or may not be linked to other attributes like timestamps, user IDs, or other attributes like the richer dataset shown above:\n",
