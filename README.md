# Clickstream-Analysis
A scratchpad to aggregate some clickstream code for the team. Should go private when we deal with more proprietary stuff.

Collaborators: John Dillon, Munira Syed

# Requirements

I recommend using the standard Anaconda installation for Python, and some other packages which are listed below in order to run this notebook:

* lifelines [https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines]
* pymining [https://github.com/bartdag/pymining]
* fp-growth [https://github.com/enaeseth/python-fp-growth] (part of pymining)
* [room to add more as I expand this notebook]

#Disclaimer
Shown in the repo are some snippets of code I found useful when dealing with structred clickstream datasets. Care has been taken to attribute work to original authors. If you feel that your work has been used and not cited (or not cited how you'd like it to be cited), please feel free to email me.

Some of the snippets are original code and can be used while adhering to the standard MIT license provided in the last cell of this notebook
